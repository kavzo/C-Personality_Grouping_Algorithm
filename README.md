# C-Personality_Grouping_Algorithm
This personality grouping algorithm is inspired by the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) quiz and the Keirsey Temperament Sorter. A prerequisite is that the students/members to be entered into the algorithm must have completed a MBTI type quiz to determine their personality trait.

The MBTI identifies and describes 4 different dichotomies for human personalities ( Extrovert [E] vs Introvert [I], Sensing [S] vs Intuition [N], Thinking [T] vs Feeling [F], Judging [J] vs Perception [P] ). There are a possible 16 different combinations of personality types. There is usually 85+ questions in the quiz, example of the overall questions is, “1. Where do you get your energy?”, the answers are determining extroverts (E) or introvert (I); “2. How do you absorb information in”, do you use sensing (S) or intuition (N); “3. How do you make decisions ?”, do you think (T) or feel (F); 4. “How do you organize you world?”, do you use judgment (J) or perception (P). The Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KSP) is a shorter test; however, it is linked to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and it is able to group the results from the MBTI (Vital, 2019). Demonstrated in the table below:
KSP (Main Groups)	MBTI (Personality traits)
Artisans	  1.	ESTP	2.	ISTP	3.	ESFP	4.	ISFP
Guardians	  5.	ESTI	6.	ISTJ	7.	ESFJ	8.	ISFJ
Rationales	9.	ENTJ	10.	INTJ	11.	ENTP	12.	INTP
Idealists	  13.	ENFJ	14.	INFJ	15.	ENFP	16.	INFP

Based on a study performed by, J. E. Humble and R. A. Pennwell-Cooper, "Assigning Collaborative Learning Pairs Based on Personality Testing", where they separated students based on their personality types from the MBTI assessment. They concluded that some groups of students did show improvements and suggested that performance is improved when the majority of group members possess characteristics similar to other individuals in the group (Humble and Pennwell-Cooper, 2010). Combined with a study, by Fernandes, C. and Polzer, E, called “Diversity in Groups” describes how groups have an increase chance of improvement if there is some diversity in the group, were not all members in the group show the same characteristic traits (FERNANDES and POLZER, 2015).

The Program:
The program asks the user for the number of students in the group (an exception error will display if a number is not entered) then asks for the numerical value of personality type per student  (based on the MBTI results, which is 1 to 16, if not within that range the student will be left out of the final results). 
The output shows the total students in a group, a percentage of students per field (Artisans, Guardians, Rationales, and Idealists), whether the group dynamics are positive or negative (which is based on whether a personality field is equal to or greater than 50%), if the group has good or bad diversity (depending if only 1 type of personality trait is entered within a group e.g. if all students in the group has the same personality type). Depending on the “Group Dynamics” and the “Group Diversity” the final group results determines if the students should be in a group or not.
